## Laboratory and Observatory Instrument Support

This package has modules for operating commercial lab equipment.  Locally built instruments are supported by the MonitorControl package.

Instruments are grouped by manufacturer.  For now they are:
* Agilent \(repository Electronics_Instruments_Agilent\)
* Valon   \(repository Electronics_Interfaces_Valon\)

Each of these has its own repository.
